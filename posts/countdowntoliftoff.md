### "I'm doing a lot of things, if you don't catch me now I'm liable to rocket into the stratosphere without you"

#### Starting final liftoff countdown

#### [[ 5 ]]

The above title is a quote from me of a few months ago, while I was still presently homeless in a shelter with no money. I'm usually a very humble person but I break that rule whenever it comes to using quotes from a very difficult time in my life. Also it'll help take some of the edge off of what you may or may not be about to read.

Content warning: my life is nontrivially intense. But I'm going to keep it short and try to skip over details whenever possible. Sexual and physical assualt mentions ahead.

I AM BORN! I AM BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD, VIA MY WONDERFUL MOTHER, KAREN CAMPBELL. Yea, life is given to me. I'm sure it was messy and wet ordeal. It was also the appparently just a little bit early, and the first of 6 (3 brothers via my mom, 2 sisters via my dad, all younger). So I'm born, and then...

???

I'm born and then I don't know. My working memory starts at 8 / 9 years old, as opposed to the norm which I'm told is roughly 4 - 6. Strings of therapists have all came to the conclusion that it's most likely PTSD, and broken bits of memory [that phrase makes me think of Kingdom Hearts] have led me to believe said PTSD is a result of a really intense sexual assault.

So yea, 8. Things going on: living with my mom and 3 brothers, we are hella poor, I see my dad sometimes, mom remarries and he's physically abusive to everyone, some stuff happens with a dead body, bla bla bla oh the perils of urban black youth. I'm REALLY REALLY good at school though.

#### [[ 3 ]]

Like, crazy good at school. Up until high school, there was not a class that I was not at the top of. Except maybe English, because English teachers are not a fan of the way that I write I guess. But I was of those 4.0 (so, straight A's aka 90%+ marks) GPA for the entirity of elementary school kids, which rocked. I'm sort of wondering why more good things didn't happen to me during this time frame, like skipping three years (I didn't skip any, I just recall being asked to do so three seperate times) and going off to study in a foreign country. Oh wait, I do know. It's because I was black.

Now dear reader, let me give you snippet of the life of a "gifted" (which I always felt was a strange phrase but it was always applied to me) black child. I started out with my mom, she was very poor. Like, the food stamps check was all of our food for the month sort of poor. My dad on the other hand, was an accountant. When he found out how well I was doing, I was shipped off to live with my dad instead of my mom. Also I was sort of aggressive. So was he. We'll get into that in a bit.

The biggest feature of a poor black male **[1]** child's early life is violence. Violence everywhere, violence all the time. I got into A LOT of fights. Apparently I looked sort of gay? Looking gay = more violence. Also I was pretty smart and being pretty smart = more violence. Also I was actually a bit poorer than the average poor black kid and being poorer lead to... [you can guess, I'm sure]. So there were fights, many of which I was suspended for. I was suspended somewhere around a half dozen times, all for fighting. The funny thing was, for the majority of the semesters during which I was suspended, I still had a 4.0 GPA. I'm sure this confused teachers greatly. But nobody really did anything about it, so on to high school we go!

#### [[ 2 ]]

High school was one step forward, two steps backward. Teen angst and a general increase in maturity meant less fights. But teen angst is caused by hormones, hormones whose effects I very much did not approve of [if you're new here: I'm trans. pronouns she / her, don't fuck it up thanks]. Mainly because of the hormones thing, I was very depressed. Still very good at school though (3.5 GPA)! Just... not as good, not top of class, mainly because of the depression. I was defintely "that smart nerdy emo gay kid" though. Which totally sounds like someone you'd want to hang out with, yea? Yea!

What happens next is that my emotionally bankrupt "but well meaning" father decides he needs to fix the marginal drop in my academic preformance. His fixes were mostly violent. ...Actually, they were all violent. And by violent I mean physically abusive. CPS was called a few times - BY ME [the child!!!]. CPS [Child Protective Services] didn't really do anything except harass my dad into feeding us more. Which was funny [and by funny I mean sad] because he was / is a massively overweight **[2]** and VERY well paid accountant with underweight children - and his excuse was always that food costs too much.

The institution of CPS still to this day annoys me for its lack of action. But really it's not CPS at large, it's the history and conditioning of black CPS workers having to deal with a black family. White CPS has historically been overbearing on black families, so black CPS is / was underbearing to compensate **[3]**. In my case, this was a mistake. But whatever, I fixed it myself eventually. And by "I fixed it myself" I mean that tensions escalated until one day I punched my dad in the face and ran away. 

Oh, and another sexual assault happens in here somewhere. It was pretty meh. And so, on to college!

#### [[ 1 ]]

You are probably thoroughly overwhelmed at this point, so this section will be short. I go off to college, and life got marginally better. Trans related [although I didn't know that's what it was at the time] depression was steadily ticking up, though. Depression plus objective talent let to a ton of shitty liberatian feels. I think there was some mens rights activism (MRA) in there too. I'm 100% sure I owned a fedora, and **before** the fedora even became known as a MRA thing. I played waaaaaaaay too much call of duty. Things continue this way until...

OMG WAIT I MUST ACTUALLY BE A GIRL

Yep, girl. I discover than I'm a girl at 19 and it is instantly as if a glowing lesbian angel descends from the heavens, gifting upon me queerness and hotness, and removing [most of] the depression and shitty politics. I'm pretty excited about it. Many hundreds of selfies are taken. It's all sunshine and rainbows - except not. Because transphobia. Oh my gosh transphobia. Transphobia compels [but does not "force"] me to drop out of college, and then to leave where I grew up (Washington DC) to make a pilgrimage to the queer promised land of San Francisco. It was a good decision.

From here on, the story takes a fairly positive turn, [but perhaps you've read that bit already?](http://lynncyrin.me/post/origin-story)

Notes:

* [1] I'm transfeminine and will sometimes refer to myself as male in the past tense depending on how long ago it was. This reference point was nearly a decade ago. But - DO NOT EVER ask me about "previous maleness". Also, as a general rule if you are not trans you are still required to refer to pre-transition trans women with she / her pronouns, unless stated otherwise.

* [2] Let me openly admit here that I am in fact fat-phobic, but generally only with men and also I like to think that I'm still a bit less fat-phobic than the average person. It's something that I work on, A LOT. If I fuck up please point it out.

* [3] This problem is an artifact of racism. Racism whose primary cause is white people. But even worse than that, I myself am being racist in this paragraph. Me, black, being racist towards other black people. This coming from someone who is very inclined to reblog things with #KillAllWhitePpl. **I** am still a racist. So if you are white and think you aren't racist, you had better sit the fuck down.
