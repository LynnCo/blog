### How Lynn Became Our Story's Protagonist

#### Preface

I've been meaning to write this post for WEEKS now. It's been consistently delayed because of all the wonderful things that have happened to me super recently, but also because I to some extent I really dislike writing about this sort of thing. But I feel like I should, and that it'll be helpful in some way. Please note that while I'm extra vague about (or just straight up leave out) a lot of the details, it starts off a bit intense.

#### CRISIS STRIKES!

So I've mentioned having been homeless often enough that I think most people have heard about it, and that's where I'm going to start this off. What do I mean by "homeless" though? Well, there are 3 main types of modern urban homelessness that I know about: couch surfing, sleeping in your car, sleeping in a shelter, sleeping outside. They represent a spectrum of approximately how much society values the welfare of that particular individual, as we don't live in an ideal society that garuntees every person the luxury of a place to sleep that is relatively safe and stable (whether or not we COULD sounds like a fun economics question). But I was couch surfing, and in a shelter (two of them actually). Couch surfing I think most people can imagine. On the other hand sleeping in a shelter can be a very surreal experience, especially when you juxtapose the two shelters I was in. 

1st - women's domestic violence shelter. Fairly calm place. 3 meals a day. Your own bedroom, bathroom shared with 3 people. Average age 35. Lots of children running around. Curfew was 10pm.

2nd - young adult (18 - 24) shelter. Incredibly erractic and dangerous environment. 1.5 meals a day. 30 ~ 40 people in the 'room', with high concrete partitions (they didn't touch the ceiling and so weren't walls) separating the room into [door-less] single gender sleeping areas of 4 ~ 7. Bathroom shared with 15 ~ 20 people. Curfew was 7pm.

The 1.5 meals part of the second shelter is actually a pretty important point. Because, if you're homeless and 18, how are you going to eat? Well you need money - and for money you probably need a job. It's very likely going to be retail. While working on said job, you aren't allowed to show any obvious signs of homelessness. In fact, the majority of the homeless people I know are by no means visibily indenfiable as such. If you frequent low end retail (example: Walgreens or CVS), I would be willing to bet that you've been assisted by someone experiencing some degree of homelessness.

#### Training Montage

That was a short advocacy aside, because I was not actually employed during the time I was homeless. I was instead working on training my coding skills. In my opinion, learning to code while homeless is a ton easier than working retail while homeless. But objectively, here's an example day of mine (in the 2nd shelter):

*	**8am** Mandatory to be out of the shelter by this time
*	**8a - 9a** Writing code on my [paper] notebook while sitting outside (+1)
*	**9a - 12p** Writing code on my laptop in the library (+3)
*	**12p - 1p** Hunt for free food
*	**1p - 3p** Sleep (somewhere random idk)
*	**3p - 6p** Writing code on laptop at the LGBT center similar (+3)
*	**630p** In by curfew
*	**7p - 9p** normal human stuff (eat, clean, text ppl, etc...)
*	**9p - 11p** Sleep (in shelter)
*	**12p - 3a** write code on notebook in shelter (+3)
*	**3a** Sleep (in shelter)

So there are a few things to note here. First, I was 'at work' for 10 hours a day generally. This is actually a low point in that respect, when I was in the other shelter it was 12 hours and when I was couch surfing it was 14. Second, I had my laptop no more than 10 feet away from me at any given time (showers were not an expection), but it wasn't always safe to use it. Writing code on paper can be good experience to have sometimes though! Third, I kept this sort of schedule up for about 4 months. That is the, write / read code for 10+ hours a day while eating minimally and living in super unstable housing (shelters are inherently unstable but also I had to move once every month during this time period).

I'm not really too sure what my motivation to do all this work was. Something told me that it was all going to pay off in some way, but I really didn't know how. I told myself that I was going to use all of this coding skills to get stablely employed in some way, but in restrospect I realize that REALLY wasn't going to happen. But I kept working, learning, gettting to know people, and then something did happen...
