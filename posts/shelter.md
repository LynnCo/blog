So here's the idea. There exists street homelessness (sleeping on the streets), and sheltered homelessness (sleeping in a shelter). Sheltered homelessness is less of a burden to soceity, the homeless people aren't nearly as hard to track, and much easier to provide services for. [A homeless outreach worker describes as much here](http://imsorrythatimlikethis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/the-spikes/). 

So, why do people still opt for street homelessness over sheltered homelessness? Well, let me tell you a story...

#### A snip of my shelter experience

...I'm in a homeless youth shelter in the poorest part of San Francisco. I generally spend my nights in the shelter coding while sitting in my bed - it's usually easier to sleep in the daytime at the LGBT Center or the Public Library or the Community Clinic. This night was a good example of why I generally "work nights", a lot of the other clients (shelters are providing a "service", and thusly you are a "client") are upset because the food was bad this evening and then staff didn't let them outside on their second smoke break. "Didn't let them outside" that is, if you're going to stay in the shelter at all you are required to be physically in the building from 7pm - 6am, aside from two 15 minute breaks. The breaks are called "smoke breaks" as that's what the majority of the clients do. But I don't smoke, so me and my girlfriend usually went the corner store to buy food to smuggle back into the dorms. "Dorms". We had to smuggle it back in because we aren't allowed to take food back to our rooms but we have better things to do (usually kissing) with our 15 minutes outside than calmly eat chips while sitting on the sidewalk.

But on this particular day that didn't happen because no 2nd "smoke break" for whatever reason. So people were just a tad bit agitated. To cool off a bit, I decided to mix my evening programming binge with a bit of Minecraft. So I'm sitting in my "dorm", playing minecraft on my gigantic 6 year old laptop and tablet open to some python code I was writing earlier. To help make the scene, let me describe this "dorm" situation to you. All 30 - 40 clients are given a bed in the same "room", a "room" being defined as an enclosed space with walls floor and a ceiling. By this definition all the clients are housed in the same "room", although that "room" is divided into 7 single gender partitions by dividing walls that stop roughly 2 feet from the ceiling. Also there are no doors, where a door should be there is instead a large door shaped hole. So literally, its a "room" inside which are contained several partitions. I particularly like the phrase partition because when I was living here I spent several weeks working on writing a program to partition the galaxy into groups of constellations. I'm tempted to describe it as a dorm which contains several rooms. But it's not, it's a room that contains several partitions. It's akin to if you took a dorm and erased the top two feet of wall before they touch the ceiling, and removed all the doors.

To top it off, my particular partition was "home" to 7 girls (half of them trans). Each client is given some white sheets and a twin bed, underneath which is a drawer about the size of what you'd see near the top of an office desk (you know, the extra long one that's right beneath the desk part). Also the beds are spaced roughly 3 feet from each other. Because of this, the floor is filed with piles and piles of travel bags and black trash bags with client's belongs in them - besides a small path in the middle so you can walk to the beds. Think about it as your room at its absolute messiest except with other people's stuff, which they don't clean unless staff threatens to kick them out for their room being too messy. Also our particular partition is right across from a boy's partition, although luckily I never caught boys staring at me from their bed at night.

Onto this scene place me, sitting on my very well made bed surrounded by a few stuffed animals and staring at my computer / tablet. How both those devices managed to survive this living situation is a mystery (many many many things are known to get stolen in this shelter). But they did, and there I was when a very obnoxious girl walks into our partition. She's known for getting into loud arguments with other clients at 7am and being forced to leave the building early, although on this particular day its 11pm and she's arguing with someone on her phone instead. She comes into the partition having a loud aggressive conversation on her phone, and stands beside my neighbor's bed. I believe she's waiting for my neighbor to show up to give her something, but in the meantime she's standing right beside me yelling into her phone loud enough for me to hear loud and clear over my headphones. I'm a bit annoyed, but besides that she's breaking three rules:

no phones in the "dorms"
no being loud in dorms
no entering someone else's partition (aka their "room")

Because I'm more than a little bit annoyed and this is literally the only time this week I had scheduled out for something that isn't work (writing code / learning programming was my work) I decide to say

"Hey could you maybe quiet it down a bit?" *makes downward hand motion*

She gives me a very aggressive and mean face

I flip her off

**--- FIGHT SCENE ---**

...not really. There was almost a fight scene though! She gets mad that I flipped her off, and starts yelling. I close my laptop and start shouting back, mainly letting loose pent up frustration over the fact that this girl is rude and obnoxious several times a week. At this point my girlfriend shows up and calmly inquires what all the yelling is about. Except minus the calmly part. Rude girl aggros on my girlfriend (the phrase "girlfriend used taunt!" comes to mind here) and starts yelling at her instead. Eventually staff shows up. Girlfriend and rude girl are taken away. I'm still fuming. Other clients are even more annoyed because of our little shouting match. Nobody is happy.

A few minutes later, rude girl stomps back to her partition muttering curses. My girlfriend doesn't show back up. I get very panicked very quickly. Staff doesn't monitor the dorms overnight and rude girl has more friends than I do. No fucking way I'm going to sit exposed on my bed with nothing to defend myself with. So I grab my tablet and head up to hang out with staff for a bit. And by hang out with staff I mean I'm on my tablet doing my galaxy building thing in python while staff is at their desk doing their staff thing. Staff does not appreciate my presence in front of their desk at 12am. I compel them to get over it, for the safety of their clients. I sit there coding for 4 hours until 3am when my girlfriend shows up with a largish glass bottle of drink. The glass bottle will be important later. She gives some sort of excuse for why she's just now getting back and heads to her bed. I follow her and then head back to my own bed, reassured by the presence of my girlfriend, who if nothing else is a much better fighter than I am.

630 am, only two and a half hours later, staff wakes us all up. This is an early day, but only by a little - staff usually gets us up at 700am. Everyone is their usual "why the fuck are we up at 630" annoy in addition to the excuse annoyance from last night. I, for the most part, am still triggered. I try to get over it by very calmly and carefully getting dressed extra nice that morning. All is well until...

**--- CRISIS STRIKES ---**

A boy walks into our room, and sits on my neighbor's bed. She doesn't consent to him doing that, but she has the bed right next to the hallway so boys will often plop themselves on her bed since its like 2 feet from the hallway. They're sort of friends though so they start talking. Well really, he starts talking at her. I watch this out of the corner of my eye for a bit as I try to awkwardly get red for my day with this boy now sitting in our partition. Note, there's a rule about not being in someone else's "room" but there's an -extra- rule about not being in an opposite gender "room". Also nobody except maybe (but probably not) the girl whose bed who is sitting on wants him here. A bit into his "conversation", he decides to appraise all the girls in the room. He gets to me, and this is what I get:

"That white[1] girl over there looks like a nigga[2], why the hell are her boobs[3] so small[4]"

*	[1] racism
*	[2] transphobia
*	[3] sexual harassment
*	[4] misogyny

This upset me just a tad bit, I asked him to leave

The girl whose bed he was sitting on asked him to leave

He then challenges out right to get him to leave

I ask him to leave again, more assertively this time

He stands up aggressively, demands that I "make him leave"

[...]

Generally at this point I would recognize a fight that I wouldn't win, and disengage. This is usually the best option for everyone involved. Except for two issues. First, he is standing in the god damn entrance way (I'd say doorway but remember, no doors) to our partition. Second, I happen to notice my girlfriend's glass bottle from last night. Suddenly, this is a fight that I CAN win. That fact is not, repeat NOT, a good turn of events for anyone involved. I pick up the glass bottle and bang it against the wall. It doesn't break because I'm not cool and this isn't the movies. I hold it up anyways and point it at his face.

"Let's go"

**--- FIGHT SCENE ---**

Nope.jpg what actually happens next is that my girlfriend (who was sitting about 15 feet away this whole time) decides to intervene via restraining me. And it's great that I had a girlfriend and that she was in the room with me at that particular moment in time because there is nobody else in the world I would have let restrain me at the time. While restrained I decide to yell for staff and staff appears, yay. Staff take rude boy away, which rocks. At this time its about 8am, and clients are required to be out of the building by 8am on some days (including today!). So everyone is out of the building except me and my girlfriend as we are both sitting on my bed (note: there's a rule that you aren't allowed to sit on each other's beds) trying to calm me down, as I'm so thoroughly in fight mode that I believe I've gained a HUD [head's up display] and ammo counter. My favorite staff is working that day shows up and she allows us to stay in for a bit and also tries to defuse me a bit. I eventually calm down enough to ask her if she can maybe kick rude boy out. Nope, she says she isn't legally allowed to do anything unless a staff witnessed the incident.

Me "Well if you can't kick him out then I'm gonna leave"

Fav staff lady "[again] ...legally allowed to do anything...."

#### [[ ...TO BE CONTINUED!!! ]]

This story goes on for a bit, but I don't want to publish it all just yet (the rest will come out with [Interrupt Mag](https://twitter.com/Interrupt_mag)). Hopefully it makes my point, of why exactly someone wouldn't want to stay in a shelter. It was during this point that I gave A LOT of consideration to sleeping on the street, but could not due to it being so thoroughly discouraged by the government (Note: I live in San Francisco where there aren't literally spikes on the ground but there are many less obvious changes to prevent street homelessness). I was 'forced' to stay in this place, with these people. While I was there, I had several people tell me that they'd rather sleep on the street than at the shelter, and they were only sleeping out the shelter either because of the police or because the shelter feeds the people that live there (as opposed to like, feeding everyone that's homeless).
