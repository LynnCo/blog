<h3>Name Change Press Release</h3>
<p>So you might have seen me go by either Lynn Conway, or Lynn Cyrin? Why this thing? Three reasons!</p>
<p><b>1)</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway">Other Lynn Conway</a>. We are entirely too similar. Lynn Conway transgender? Lynn Conway engineering? Lynn Conway lesbian? Nope, all true get both of us.</p>
<p><b>2)</b> When I first transitioned I wanted to changed my entire name, but after being pestered by transphobic family and their mindless dislike for change, I decided to only change my first name + get rid of my middle name. I would have honestly prefered to change my last name also - and I finally feel entitled to do that?</p>
<p><b>3)</b> "Cyrin" fits my personal brand a lot better ^^</p>
<p><b>So what do I call you call me now?</b> - Lynn Cyrin ["sigh rin"]. My favorite thing about this name change is that I'm equally comfortable with you using my last name to address me in social contexts (although if you do that without giving me a heads up first I might not notice).</p>
<p><b>Which one is my legal name? Am I going to get it changed?</b> - "Lynn Conway", and eventually I'll change it, yea.</p>
<p><b>What about [PRETRANSITION NAME REDACTED]?</b> - Under no circumstances should anyone actually call me that. HR might need it for something, but that's about it.</p>
