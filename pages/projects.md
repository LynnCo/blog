### My Projects

this is just a brain dump until I can rewrite it coherently... Maven's site, my site, mentee, AGCM, galaxy, space game, yocto proj

[Maven's site](https://github.com/MavenYouth/Website/) [...] IDK, it's super in flux right now ask me later

[my site](https://github.com/LynnCo/blog) is super active at the moment

[AGCM](http://lynnco.github.io/AGuideToClassMobility/) has been a low priority thing for the last month, but I had to have some updates in the next month or so. Expect to see a flurry of work on it come september (I'll be in school)

[galaxy sim](https://github.com/LynnCo/galaxySim) thing is really pretty and ready for some production gifs whenever I get around to simulating them. They don't look at all like galaxies but they're pretty enough!

[space game](https://github.com/LynnCo/UnnamedSpaceGame/) is the most inactive of inactive projects but I'm looking to put some time into reorganizing and updating the code sometime soon

[yocto project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/opw-internship) work starts as a part of my OPW internship - which starts in May? June? idk. But it'll be full time and very difficult
