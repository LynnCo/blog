### [Fuck No Tech](http://lynncyrin.me/post/fuck-no-tech)

So let me be the "marginalized person" (i.e. black transgender mentally disabled woman of color who grew up hella poor and is currently homeless) who goes on record as saying - no it's not the pipeline, it's not a problem of inspiring more diverse people to get into your community, it's not a problem making tech more accessible, no. It's none of those things. It's you buttheads being:

* misogynist
* racist
* capitalist
* transphobic
* ableist
* cissexist
* shortsighted
* privileged as all hell

<readmore></readmore>

So basically all the things that I blatantly am not. It's you all flying the "diversity" and "inclusion" banners because it wins you advocacy points with your fellow embodiments of structural oppression (read: other white people) while at the same time doing NOTHING AT ALL to make sure you are actually are trying to include these people. BUT BARELY ANYONE EVEN FLIES THE BANNERS IN THE FIRST PLACE

AND anddddd all of the women I just qouted are significantly more privileged than me! So with all my identities and structural issues, what do you think it feels like to me? Well, it feels like the pipeline leads to an emotional warzone. To extend this metaphor, it feels like for people who are not:

* cis
* white
* male
* at least middle class
* abled
* straight

The pipeline does not drop you off at ground level, but instead progressively higher in the air. At some points, you need to be given certain equipment in order to survive. At my level (queer woman of color), that height is [from orbit] and the equipment is [a drop pod]. A long time ago (aka several months and >3,000 tweets ago) I jokingly commented that I was being inserted into tech as an ODST (Orbital Diversity Shock Trooper)... little did I know that this what in fact true. And guess what? It's been about a year and I am 100% tired of it. Done. I was not loaded with enough supplies for this combat sortie.

I'll also mention that my area of operations was mainly tech feminism and I burnt out on THAT in a year. Take note of that geek feminists etc.

So feel free to email the founder of generic tech company with white dude founder (so basically 99% of them) and tell him that the bigots have won and the TWoC isn't even going to apply in the first place. No need to go into complex legal issues over why she's being bounced around so much.

#### "Lynn Admits Defeat! Whatever Shall We Do Now! Hope is lost!"

Well no, not really. This post starts off by talking about all the things I'm **NOT** going to do purely because they are the things that society has been passively pushing me and individuals have been actively pushing me to do. I just wanted to craft the ideological framework on top of which I make this decision:

#### ---What I AM going to do---

Work almost exclusively with community organizations, non-profits, crowd funded organizations. Or just generally ones that have proven advocate track records or serve community in other ways! So groups that I've already worked with, like

* [Model View Culture](http://modelviewculture.com)
* One Web For All
* Double Union

---

But white feminism? Ugh

Self sustaining POC communities

Community entities

Giving to people who are likely to advance the systems
