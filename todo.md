page and post as different templates

links work locally

make tests

fold the contact buttons into a footer

re-impliment single page app and animated page swaps

h3 in post autolinks to itself

h4 is title (need character length)

h5 is description (need character length)

for every post.md -> post.html post-metadata.html

footer scrolling links

upgrade to python 34

upgrade css (a neverending task)

priority css: tweet sizing for mobile

add to title based on page

Need to equally space the nav

And decrease the transition time on the button click. ...or enable it at all? I think it's disabled.
