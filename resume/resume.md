Lynn Cyrin
===========

Full Stack Web Developer, Project Manager
<http://lynncyrin.me>

I'm a web developer looking for freelance or part time work either remotely, or in the Portland, Oregon area. The majority of my technical experince is with small teams, doing multifunction roles in modern, agile environments. I primarily develop backend infrastucture for web applications serving nontechnical users.

My nontechnical contributions revolve around community, access, identity, and diversity. The majority of this work is heavily integrated with online communities and social media (search for "Lynn Cyrin"). I expect any org I work with to support work like Transh4ck and Women Who Code.
