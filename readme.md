FLASK BLOG YAAAAAYYYYYY

[WIP INSTRUCTIONS!]

How to make this into your own blog:

Delete everything in posts, for sure. Maybe delete everything in pages? It's just weird because they are hard linked... idk. Please please don't copy my css, that'd be weird. I'll work on making the routing functions less hard link, more glob + regex. like, stick a markdown file in /pages called "email" "contact" "facebook" or whatever else and it'll automattical be created as a page at yourwebsite.com/contact. Stuff like that
