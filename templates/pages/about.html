<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a computer science student and Dean's Scholar at Mills College. I've been actively working on a tech career for a few years now, and see it mainly as a means to an end (the end being destroying capitalism, decolonizing our culture, and spreading queerness). That being said, I love working on web development, data science, and game development projects. I'm also an African American transwoman, and I'm constantly looking for more ways to help transwomen of color, homeless women, and trauma survivors. When I'm not doing any of those things, I'm probably playing League of Legends.</p>
