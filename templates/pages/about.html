<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a computer science student and Dean's Scholar at Mills College. I love working on web development, data science, and game development projects. I'm also an African American transwoman, and I'm constantly looking for more ways to help transwomen of color, homeless women, and trauma survivors. When I'm not doing any of those things, I'm probably playing League of Legends.</p>
