<h3>About Such Lynn</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Lynn Cyrin, human girl, transgender woman of color, and tech nerd. I like social justice and long walks through the element inspector. I live in the Bay Area and work in both tech and activism (often at the same time).</p> 
<p>Things to know about me! I do front end web development, and I'm working on getting into data science. I also like game development, but mostly as a hobby. I really really want to be a teaching professor eventually!</p>
<p>Most of my free time is spent programming, the results of which you can see around my site~</p>
