### Stuff about website

Source code is on [github](https://github.com/LynnCo/blog), site hosting is via [heroku](http://heroku.com/)

I had this as a rails (w/ jekyll) site but I'm not so fond of rails, ruby so I'm working on building up all the capabilities rails has into a flask blog. Will probably package up it up to be given to people eventually! At the current time its a fully functional personal flask site.

Development is done on firefox and a mid resolution (1366x768) laptop. Not presently [but will in the future] testing Chrome / IE / Safari, and probably won't ever work on high resolution styling.

Uses media queries for mobile and tablet layouts. Mobile is done, tablet needs a bit of work.

Tech Stack:

*   [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
*   [A variety of python modules](https://github.com/LynnCo/blog/blob/master/requirements.txt)
*   [Sass (via pyscss)](http://sass-lang.com/)
*   [Google fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)
*   [Prefixfree.js](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/)
*   [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
*   [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

(and some more that I won't bother to list)
