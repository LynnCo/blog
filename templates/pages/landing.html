<h3>About this website</h3>
<p>This is my blog thing? I really liked the blogs of other activists and figured that I'd set up my own. It has a bit more color than most people's... hopefully that works with your eyes! (if not then please <a href="http://lynncyrin.me/contact">email me</a> about it I want everyone to be comfortable &lt;3) As a tech person I decided I would <a href="https://github.com/LynnCo/blog">create most of this blog on my own</a>, it's a labor of love that I've put somewhere above 100 hours into so far. I hope you like it!</p>
