<h3>Professional Overview</h3>
<h4>--- VERY WIP ---</h4>
<p>Lynn Conway <a href='http://lynncyrin.me/name'>[aka Lynn Cyrin]</a> is a computer science student and Dean's Scholar at Mills College. She has been studying programming for roughly a year, and sees it mainly as a means to an end â€“ the end being destroying capitalism, decolonizing our culture, and spreading queerness. That being said, she does love working on web development, data science, and game development projects. She's also an African American transwoman, and is constantly looking for more ways to help transwomen of color, homeless women, and trauma survivors. When she isn't doing any of those things, she's probably playing League of Legends.</p>
