### My Projects

[Maven's site](https://github.com/MavenYouth/Website/) [...] IDK, it's super in flux right now, ask me later.

[My site](https://github.com/LynnCo/blog) my most active endeavor right now!

[A Guide to Class Mobility](http://lynnco.github.io/AGuideToClassMobility/) has been a low priority thing for the last month, but I had to have some updates in the next month or so. Expect to see a flurry of work on it come september (I'll be in school). Aside from the information I'm also working on mentoring the wonderful Ms. Klaine Justo!

[Galaxy Sim](https://github.com/LynnCo/galaxySim) thing is really pretty and ready for some production gifs whenever I get around to simulating them. They don't look at all like galaxies but they're pretty enough!

[Space Game](https://github.com/LynnCo/UnnamedSpaceGame/) is the most inactive of inactive projects but I'm looking to put some time into reorganizing and updating the code sometime soon (ie in the next few months)

[Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/opw-internship) work starts as a part of my OPW internship - which starts in May? June? idk. But it'll be full time and very engaging
