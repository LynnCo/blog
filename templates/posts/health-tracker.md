### [IDEA! Community Health Tracker](http://lynncyrin.me/post/health-tracker)

So on the heels of a [facebook being mildly more invasive than normal](http://www.avclub.com/article/facebook-tinkered-users-feeds-massive-psychology-e-206324), a [series](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2014/07/03/transgender-woman-attacked-in-l5p) of [events](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis) that were very bad for community health, and short conversation with my partner cutie, I had an idea!

Generally, [sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) has been used by massive social media platforms to gather all sorts of data on its users, usually for the sake of profit or control. But sentiment analysis can also be used to monitor the health of an online community / online discourse for the sake of the people engaging with it. [I talk about community health for a bit here](http://lynncyrin.me/post/community-health), but basically I want to have a broad idea of when my friends are happy or sad, along with what's going on with them! Basically, a level of data analysis for all the great communities and networks are people have already built. Here are some basic use cases:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p>ex: &#10;&#10;feminist hacker community mood is: sad&#10;currently trending: github</p>&mdash; lynn, productivity! (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/485581649942294530">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p>you&#39;re going to get A LOT of sadness spikes with trans community and physical assault stuff.&#10;&#10;but, idk. is good to know about this stuff?</p>&mdash; lynn, productivity! (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/485581972580745217">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Those use cases are all sad because that's just how my communities have been trending lately (...imagine! being able to conclusively state that your communities have been trending towards sadness) but I'm sure there'd be happiness use cases too! Also, once you had all this information - which I would want to craft a VERY clearly worded "hey we are going to read all your tweets" statement for - I'm sure there's more information people would want to know.Now, about that reading and doing math on all your tweets bit. If I were to create this, at release I imagine it would be a tool mostly used for community groups like so:

* you go onto the website, and create a group of people (ex: feminist hackers)
* you add yourself to the group of people that is -ok- being tracked with respect to the health of that group.
* your friends add themselves to the "feminist hacker" group
* the website then does its thing, reading you and your friends tweets and trying to guess at what you all are feeling and what you are talking about
* there will be a "feminist hackers" group page on the website that you can visit and it'll tell you what it's guessing
* [idea] the group page can have some sort of privacy associated with it if you don't want to whole internet to know they you are having sad day?

Now hopefully that sounds as cool to you as it does to me :D here's some words from people who also thought it was cool!
