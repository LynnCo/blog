### [Deconstruction: San Francisco's *Visible Class War](http://lynncyrin.me/post/desconstructing-sanfranciscos-class-war)

[The article in question,](https://medium.com/editors-picks/san-franciscos-in-visible-class-war-b83327c3371c) I have a few issues with it. Let me point them out to you!

#### Point 1, the title

Even insinuating the San Francisco's class war could be invisible, and then writing an article directed at well paid tech workers about the visibly street homeless is downplaying the effects of the "class war". It's reducing the effects of wage gaps and increasing costs of living down to just people sleeping on the street, and anyone who's been poor for more than a few days (*ahem* Congress) should know "class war" is about much more than that. There's a lot of shit to go through before one become visibly street homeless, and those experiences should be respected too.

#### Point 2, use of language

<blockquote>a colleague of mine - a self-identified libertarian - spout off about "the homeless problem." I don't remember exactly what he said, but I'm sure it fit into a well-trodden frame about no-good lazy leeches.</blockquote>

Even though this was being framed as "my coworker said something shitty", reading this still triggered me slightly. Specifically the "no-good lazy leeches" part. This is a common slur used against homeless people. Now I, having been homeless, am allowed to reclaim slurs that have been thrown at me to make my points. I own the slurs, they're mine to use. Tech workers (of which I am one, mind you) of all people DO NOT have the right to use slurs about other identities in order to prove their points. The people who those slurs become to have that right. White people don't get to say "nigga", straight people don't get to say "fag" (unless! directing qouting someone from said group, and with their consent!).

#### Point 3, people's lives as learning

<blockquote>I marched right over to him and asked if he'd ever talked to someone who was homeless. He looked at me with shock and his cheeks flushed, so I said, "Let's go!" Unwilling to admit discomfort, he followed. [...] If you're living in the Bay Area and working in tech, take a moment to do what I asked my colleague to do a decade ago. Walk around the Tenderloin and talk with someone whose poverty is written on their body.</blockquote>

So the premise here is that libertarian tech dude dick head has something about which he is grossly uninformed, and requires someone's personal time and effort in order to teach him. So clearly the answer is to march down the street and find a personal teacher for him. Moreover, everyone should do this! Go out and find a homeless person and get them to justify their existance to you. That's problem #1, actually. You're accosting homeless people for the sake of making them prove to you that they're actually homeless for valid reasons. But then that's why I don't engage with libertarians, they seem to have have that problem fairly often. 

At any rate, then there's problem #2, the fact that you are using this homeless person's time and energy to educate you for no gain on their part. Or maybe, the potential gain of you not being a bigot anymore, (which is on YOU not them). Compare that to when someone at a tech company wants to have someone teach them about a new framework. I'm sure you'd pay several hundred dollars for that. When it's an issue of social justice and oppression though? Particularly one where the person in question doesn't have the money to afford food, clothing, and shelter? Then all of a sudden, the education should be free.

This is akin to stories told by people talking about [#notyourresource](https://twitter.com/hashtag/notyourresource) on twitter, and the general trend of trying to get marginalized people to spend all of their time, and more importantly their emotional energy educating people for free. So essentially, the people who have the easiet time making money are the ones who get paid the most to talk about their experiences. Meanwhile the people who have the hardest time making money, whether because of something they were born into or circumstances outside of their control, are paid little - or more often nothing.

#### TL;DR 

The article had good intentions, but needs work. I could probably write up a few more points but alas, life, work, things that I'm actually being paid for to be done! --- OR! or. [you could pay me for it ^_^](https://www.gittip.com/LynnMagic/)
