(ok that's the last birthday mention I promise lol)

and I wake up to [the world being on fire](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis). Now I'm very invested in the world not being on fire. So despite the fact that

a) I'm currently [at the Allied Media Conference](amc.alliedmedia.org) and supposed to be doing conference things, but I'M NOT because --->

b) I'm currently a fulltime OPW intern (working on Linux stuff) and didn't exactly ask for today off

I have both those things going on, I decide that what I'm going to do instead is [join a firefighting team](http://atunit.org/). I do that basically all day. I'm hoping my OPW mentor doesn't mind. Maybe I'll show her this post to make up for it. So I do that all day and by the time I clock out its apparently dark outside already (I'm a bit jet-lagged right now, so sleep schedule bla~).

BUT I'M HUNGRY

...but my friends are all out doing conference stuff...

BUT I'M HUNGRY

#### Decision: go out on a food adventure alone.

Emboldened, I decide to don proper food adventure clothing -

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and head off campus (the conference is being held at a college campus) to places unknown, to the mythical Chinese Food Restaraunt.

Some problems arise. First, it's raining. Second, I stepped in a puddle. Third, I'm fucking tired. Fourth, it's dark. Fifth, I'm a girl. Sixth, I'm trans. Seventh, I am NOT [repeat] NOOOOOT wearing proper food adventure clothing.

...and then I actually GET to the Chinese food place...

it's at the end of a well lit parking lot, sporting a very generic poor-class chinese food restaraunt facade ([sorta like this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tHGPz1_xNIQ/UR6N15htcRI/AAAAAAAABLc/3aoW5BIsK3w/s640/8990250.jpeg)). And sitting in the doorway, is a tall (like 6'2") clearly very intoxicated black dude. I can spot these characteristics from literally like 100+ feet away. But the problem is that I'm fucking hungry. So I pop on the audio recorder on my phone, tweet this

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and head up to the door.

First thing that happens, drunk dude absolutely refuses to move from in front of the door, and instead decides to open the door for me - "Here you go miss" - in such a way that almost requires me to duck under his arm. I proceed to enter the Chinese food place unshaken (this is a joke, I am so already shaken at this point lol).

I enter the place, and IMMEDIATELY the two black dudes at the counter VERY obviously decide to check me out, then smile at me. Luckily I can tell from some nuances that neither is them is about to flirt with me, instead they are content with simply staring at me while pretending to be on the phone. Oh hey and also I decided to not wear a bra. Oh hey and also I'm fucking trans. Oh hey and also in case you forgot I look like this --->

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, yea. I order my food anyways. "It'll be 10 minutes, is that ok?". Yep, totally ok. Time is currently roughly 11:05.

#### 11:10 (5 minutes since I ordered)

Drunk dude decides to enter the store. Counter Dude #2 decides to leave. I make a series of tweets.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### 11:15 (10 minutes since I ordered)

Phone is on its last legs, drunk dude has been mumbling randomly - although at times he mumbles a thing about being hungry, store lady has been working studiously. All of a sudden Counter Dude #1 (who previously had been having a one sided conversation with store lady) decides to exit the store and sit outside. This is when drunk dude notices me - "Hey beautiful, I love you because you're cute" -, I make tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I mean tbh I haven&#39;t fought anyone in a while and it would be kinda fun I think</p>&mdash; Gay and Powerful (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/480187616256487425">June 21, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### 11:20 (15 minutes since I ordered)

The soda can I ordered as a part of my meal has run out. Food shows no signs of showing up. Drunk dude randomly hits on me twice more from across the room.

At this point it becomes clear to store lady that Drunk dude may in fact actually just be pretty hungry. She hands him a free egg roll. He looks at it - "Is that it?" - then places it on the counter. At this point I notice that he has a MASSIVE cancerous growth on his cheek. I feel sorta sorry for him for 2 seconds, but then - placated by his gift of food - he decides to transition into full time hitting on me and store lady from across the room.

#### 12:25 (20 minutes since I ordered)

At this point I'm sorta annoyed at my food taking so long. Also, two security gaurds show up and order some food. They clearly do not feel up to being in security gaurd mode and decide to sit in the corner of the room and watch drunk dude stumble around and hit on the girls (#WorstSecurityGaurdsEver).

Drunk dude finally decides to sit down instead of stumble around the room, and the seat he picks is RIGHT BESIDE ME. I let loose the loudest audible sigh I can possibly manage, then get up and move to a seat farther away from him. Except like, now that he's sitting down, Store lady is out of his line of sight and he decides to only hit on me (as he sits in his chair rocking back and forth).

#### 12:30 (25 minutes since I ordered)

At some point Counter dude #1 decides to come back into the store and start filming Drunk dude on his phone. Drunk dude decides to stand up, and move marginally closer to me. He's very tall. I'm sitting in my chair legs crossed and wearing the most stark look of displeasure I can manage. Drunk dude starts talking about murdering my boyfriend (I don't date boys lol). For someone incredibly drunk, he's fairly descriptive. "Shoot him in the head" is heard. Right after that he reaches into his pants...

...and produces neither a gun NOR his penis, for which I am infinitely thankful. Maybe he was just itchy idk. But right after this he decides to move a bit closer to me. Too close. I swap my stance to defensive. He does not notice. He actually moves a bit closer. Counter dude #1 and security dudes simply watch him. I swap my stance to aggressive, crack my knuckles, flex a bit, uncross my legs and place my feet firmly on the floor. FINALLY he notices.

Drunk dude: "Unless she's a dyke, in which case she'd probably kill me"

The amount of effort is takes not to break out in laughter at this point is enormous. You don't even know.

#### 12:35 (30 minutes since I ordered)

THE FOOD, IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. Counter lady produces several boxes, and gives them out them in order of how much she wants the individual the fuck out of her store. So Counter dude #1 first (who, when he leaves, brings Drunk dude with him). Gaurd dudes second. Me last. I wait a bit in the store pretending to shift my bags, but really waiting for them all to get farther away from the door. I leave, thanking the store lady a ton. I clear the parking lot.

#### 12:40 (2 minutes after leaving the store)

The second I'm sure I've gotten very far away everyone involved (let me tell you I listened HARD for footsteps), I let out a laugh [that sounds pretty similar to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3o8WHuOPEE&feature=kp). Because woah let me tell you that was exhilirating (but SOOOO does not at all compare to my most stressful experiences). But like its's totally fine because I HAVE SECURED VICTORY
