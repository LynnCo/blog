### [Build a Better Internet // Community Health](http://lynncyrin.me/post/community-health)

After reading a post (that I do not feel entitled to link to) about social justice community dynamics I feel like I should write about my experiences / opinions with respect to existing and interacting with online communities. In this post in particular I'm going to talk about community health!

<readmore></readmore>

So the 3 main areas that concern me with respect to online communities are health, growth, and productivity. Also the two main communities that I interact with are the feminist tech community and the trans activist community (note: these communities intersect A LOT), so everything I say should be implied to apply to them (and generally only them).

#### Health

First, health. So what makes online communities 'healthy'? Without trying to get into academic definitions - I'll personally define a health community as one that has:

* happy members
* resources flowing through it
* little infighting

#### Happiness

Having happy community members is its own reward, or at least I'm told that's how human biology works. Opening up Twitter to everyone being sads is generally not how I want to start my day. Within the communities I engage in, the biggest events the effect community happiness and thus community health are generally negative. Things like [physical assault](http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2014/07/03/transgender-woman-attacked-in-l5p) and [sexual harassment](http://adainitiative.org/2014/04/ada-initiative-no-longer-partnering-with-github/)

#### Resources

Resource flow is of particular importance for online communities because (speaking from experience) it's possible for someone to be doing a bunch of good productive community work while living in a homeless shelter and barely able to buy food and sleeping next to her abusive ex and... (/end rant) - and nobody ever notice it. When doing activism in meatspace communities you are more likely to notice that someone has resource need, whereas online communities can lead to people starving silently, so to speak. There's also the more traditional community based issue of wanting money to transfer directly from community members to good projects without having to run the gauntlet of the capitalist kyriarchy first.

For reference, resource flow in the Trans Activist community is generally for purpose of people of less people starving / suicidal / homeless. Whereas resource flow in the Feminist Tech community is generally around [start ups](http://modelviewculture.com) and [organizations](http://doubleunion.org). I'm not citing links for the trans community resource flow portion for the sake of respect, not because I don't have any (idly, I can think of 4).

Random note, [gittip has recently made itself inviable as a feminist tech resource flow tool](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis).

#### Infighting

Infighting I define as things like: unwarranted callouts, using slurs aggressively, unfairly questioning people's motives. Infighting, callouts, and callins are very similar concepts, and the same statement can probably be all 3 of those things depending on who you ask. As a general rule, I define infighting as -bad-, [callins as -good-](http://www.blackgirldangerous.org/2013/12/calling-less-disposable-way-holding-accountable/), and callouts as -productive. I'll try to give some examples:

(this is a series fake tweets between me and my partner!)

<b>Infighting</b>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GihnYih">@GihnYih</a> I&#39;m wondering if you only invited me to the conference because you wanted my money.. everyone else had plenty of speaking time -_-</p>&mdash; lynn, productivity! (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/485597431912869888">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>

There are a lot of reasons why, without any other context, this is a comment that you should not be making. I'll leave that analysis to the sociology majors though, and have that as my example of infighting. To restate, infighting is -bad- and doesn't make anyone look good.

Bonus fake tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic">@LynnMagic</a> I came here to have a good time and I&#39;m honestly feeling so attacked right now.</p>&mdash; Jocelyn Lee (@GihnYih) <a href="https://twitter.com/GihnYih/statuses/485599954300186624">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<b>Callin</b>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GihnYih">@GihnYih</a> Hey can I DM you about the conference you&#39;re running RE: women of color inclusion?</p>&mdash; lynn, productivity! (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/485598820370108417">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is me asking for a private conversation to discuss a potentially thorny political topic. It could potentially be the same issue as in the infighting example, just worded a bit differently! Callins are good, and likely to lead to a positive resolution of whatever the issue was assuming everyone invovled has to emotional energy to engage with it. In my experience the purpose of callins is generally to allow disparate community members to reconcile issues and become more comfortable with each other.

<b>Callout</b>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GihnYih">@GihnYih</a> hey so I told my friends how you treated the only WoC speaker at your con and guess where they won&#39;t be going ever again?</p>&mdash; lynn, productivity! (@LynnMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/LynnMagic/statuses/485606430330728448">July 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Callouts are fiery destructive things - and purposefully so. The purpose of callout of to publically and obviously be like DO NOT TRUST THIS PERSON THEY ARE BAD. In this respect, for activist communities callouts are productive in that they generally advance the community's goals very quickly, but at the cost of community health.

(/end fake tweets)

So now hopefully you have an idea of what sorts of things are good for community health! Now go forth, and build healthy communities~ I'll keep writing about this, and the next post will be about growth.

Meanwhile, [maybe read this other post](http://lynncyrin.me/post/health-tracker) where I talk about making a community health tracker!
